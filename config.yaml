    description: |
      Location on the filesystem where binlogs are going to be placed.

    type: string
    description: |
      Sets the max_binlog_size mysql configuration option, which will limit the
      size of the binary log files. The server will automatically rotate binlgos
      after they grow to be bigger than this value.
      Keep in mind that transactions are never split between binary logs, so
      therefore binary logs might get larger than configured value.
  binlogs-expire-days:
    default: 10
    type: int
    description: |
      Sets the expire_logs_days mysql configuration option, which will make
